# Comprehensive A-N Codebase Assessment

**Date**: 2026-03-31 22:34:57
**Scope**: Complete adversarial and detailed review targeting extreme quality levels.

## 1. Executive Summary
This automated A-N review has scanned the repository for structural integrity according to priority attributes: DRY, DbC, TDD, Orthogonality, Reusability, Changeability, and LOD.

## 2. Key Factor Findings

### DRY

### DbC
- Design-by-Contract observed, but consistency must be audited across boundary APIs.

### TDD
- Test-to-Source ratio is critically low (0.17). Comprehensive unit tests must be added.

### Orthogonality
- Extract UI from core physics/math models to prevent temporal coupling.

### Reusability
- Ensure tools module provides generic interfaces without domain-specific data bleeding.

### Changeability
- Implement Dependency Injection for heavy class initializers to increase modularity swaps.

### LOD
- Law of Demeter adherence is generally respected across scanned modules.

## 3. Recommended Remediation Plan
Create isolated PRs for each distinct finding. Prioritize TDD and DbC fixes to secure existing behavior before resolving monolithic code structural (DRY) issues.
